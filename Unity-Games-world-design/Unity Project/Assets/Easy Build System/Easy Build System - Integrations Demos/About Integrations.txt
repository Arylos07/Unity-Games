----------------------

Important : Before importing an integration make sure you have correctly imported the demos package, some models are used, like upgradable parts, demos scripts, etc...

If you hope to use one of the integrations available with Easy Build System, you need to enable integration from Easy Build System main editor then import the demo package.

If there are integrations that you do not use you can delete them to avoid errors/missings.
